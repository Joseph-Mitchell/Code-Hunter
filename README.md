# Code-Hunter
 
This project was made for College in 2019

### To run this project:

This website uses wampserver to run, so it must be cloned to the www folder of a wampserver install.

Before visiting the website the Code Hunter database must be populated. Do this by running wampserver and then visiting localhost/Code-Hunter/createdatabase.php.
Once this is done the website can be visited any time wampserver is still running by going to localhost/Code-Hunter.
